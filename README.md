I built this very basic game to practice with Python.  
I followed a tutorial that I found on YouTube by SentDex, but I modified to code to implement 2 blocks instead of one.
I also made the Car and the Blocks into classes to increase my understanding of classes.

You can move left and right using the Left and Right Arrow Keys

The objective is to dodge the incoming blocks.
The more blocks you dodge will increase the speed of the blocks.
